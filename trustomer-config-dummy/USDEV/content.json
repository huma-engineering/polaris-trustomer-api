The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location that is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by the AAA or by the arbitrator. If you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Sensyne will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. The arbitrator's decision will be based on this Agreement, when not in conflict with applicable law, and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of this Agreement, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. If the arbitrator decides that either the substance of your claim or the remedy you asked for is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, then Sensyne may use the Rules to determine whether you are responsible for the filing, administrative and arbitrator fees. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies. </span></p><p><b><span>9 GENERAL</span></b></p><p><span >9.1 This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and us relating to its subject matter and supersedes any prior agreements, undertakings, representations, warranties and arrangements of any nature, relating to the same.

We shall not be in breach of this Agreement or otherwise liable to you as a result of any delay or failure in the performance of our obligations under this Agreement to the extent that such delay or failure is caused by occurrences beyond our reasonable control including, but not limited to, acts of God, strikes, war or sabotage and the time for performance of the relevant obligation shall be extended accordingly. No failure or delay by us to exercise or enforce any right or benefit under this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver of such right or benefit, nor operate to prevent or limit the future exercise or enforcement of that right or benefit. If any term or condition of this Agreement is held invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable by any court, governmental agency or authority of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this Agreement shall remain valid and enforceable. The parties are independent contractors and nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to create any joint venture or agency relationship among the parties, and no party shall have the right to enter into contracts on behalf of, to legally bind, to incur debt on behalf of, or to otherwise incur any liability or obligation on behalf of, the other party.</span></p><p><span>If you have an inquiry regarding the GDm-Health Solution, please contact us as follows:</span></p><p><span></span><span>Address: Schr\u00f6dinger Building Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, England, OX4 4GE</span></p><p><span></span><span>Email: support@sensynehealth.com</span></p><p><span>Effective Date: 10 December 2019</span></p>",

The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location that is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by the AAA or by the arbitrator. If you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Sensyne will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. The arbitrator's decision will be based on this Agreement, when not in conflict with applicable law, and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of this Agreement, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. If the arbitrator decides that either the substance of your claim or the remedy you asked for is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, then Sensyne may use the Rules to determine whether you are responsible for the filing, administrative and arbitrator fees. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies.\u00a0 </span></p><span><p><b><span>9 GENERAL</span></b></p><p><span>9.1 This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and us relating to its subject matter and supersedes any prior agreements, undertakings, representations, warranties and arrangements of any nature, relating to the same.
